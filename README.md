# Car Price Prediction Model

![Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/balaji1732000/car-price-predict/assets/70811241/810ba7b7-8de2-4268-a84d-26e7e00e3cef)

This project involves creating a car price prediction model using different machine learning algorithms, including KNeighbors, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and more. After evaluating the performance of these algorithms, we found that Random Forest (with an accuracy score of 0.8931259105488091) performed the best. Finally, we fine-tuned the model using the GridSearchCV algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7.10
- Django Framework 3.1

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the command line.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Train the model by running `python train.py`.
2. Start the Django server by running `python manage.py runserver`.
3. Navigate to the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
4. Enter the details of the car you want to predict the price for, and the application will display the predicted price.

After evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms, we found that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best with an accuracy score of 0.8931259105488091.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

We used the GridSearchCV algorithm to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, resulting in improved accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project involves creating a car price prediction model using machine learning algorithms and integrating it with a web application using Django Framework. The model achieved high accuracy, and the application is easy to use, making it a useful tool for predicting car prices.
